<h1><a href="http://cs.txstate.edu/~g_y10/memoise">Memoise: A Tool for Memoized Symbolic Execution</a></h1>

<p class="welcome">
Memoise is a tool that supports memoized symbolic execution. It uses a trie-based data structure that stores the key elements of a run of symbolic execution. By maintaining the trie, it reuses previously computed results of symbolic execution during successive runs, without the need for re-computing them as is traditionally done. </p>

<H2>Download</H2>
<ul>
<li> Download Java PathFinder core (jpf-core) from the
<a href="http://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/trac/jpf/wiki/install/start">JPF
website</a>. The following are assuming that you install your JPF projects
under ~/projects/jpf:

<pre>mkdir ~/projects/jpf
cd ~/projects/jpf
hg clone http://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/hg/jpf/jpf-core
</pre>

<li> Download Symbolic PathFinderd (jpf-symbc) from the JPF repository.

<pre>mkdir ~/projects/jpf
cd ~/projects/jpf
hg clone http://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/hg/jpf/jpf-symbc
</pre>


<li> Download <a href="downloads/jpf-memoise.zip">Memoise</a> (jpf-memoise),  extract it and put it in ~/projects/jpf.

<!-- <pre>mkdir ~/projects/jpf -->
<!-- cd ~/projects/jpf -->
<!-- hg clone http://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/hg/jpf/jpf-memoise -->
<!-- </pre> -->


</ul>
 
<H2>Build</H2>
<ul>

<li> Before building your projects, create a site.properties file in your ~/.jpf
directory, and configure the file as instructed in the installation
instructions. Assuming that you installed your JPF projects
under ~/projects/jpf, your site.properties should look like this:

<pre>jpf.home = ${user.home}/projects/jpf
jpf-core = ${jpf.home}/jpf-core
jpf-symbc = ${jpf.home}/jpf-symbc
jpf-memoise = ${jpf.home}/jpf-memoise
extensions=${jpf-core},${jpf-symbc},${jpf-memoise}
</pre>


<li> Build projects jpf-core, jpf-symbc. For now, the class files required are
 already in jpf-memoise project, and there's no need to re-build jpf-memoise.

<!-- <pre>cd ~/projects/jpf/jpf-core -->
<!-- ant -->
<!-- cd ~/projects/jpf/jpf-symbc -->
<!-- ant -->
<!-- cd ~/projects/jpf/jpf-memoise -->
<!-- ant -->
<!-- </pre> -->

</ul>

<H2>Run</H2>
<p>We envision many applications that can be optimized using memoized symbolic
execution. For now our implementation of Memoise supports three
representative applications: iterative deepening, regression analysis, and
heuristics-guided symbolic execution.  Here, we use iterative deepening as an
example to illustrate how to use of Memoise. </p>

<p>First, an initial run of Memoise builds the trie on-the-fly and saves it on
the disk for future re-use. The following shows an example .jpf configuration: </p>

<pre>
target=Ex
classpath=${jpf-memoise}/build/examples
symbolic.method=Ex.m(sym#sym#sym)
search.depth_limit=6
listener=gov.nasa.jpf.memoise.listener.TrieBuilder
memoise.new_trie_name=trie_ex.dat
</pre>

<p>Same as other .jpf configurations used for running symbolic execution with
Symbolic PathFinder, this configuration specifies the target class and its
classpath, the method which is intended to be executed symbolically, and search
depth bound in the first four lines. The fifth line specifies the TrieBuilder
listener which builds the trie on the fly and stores the trie to the disk.  The
last line specifies the name of trie.</p>

<p>After running Memoise, a trie like the following is generated:</p>

<pre>
<table class="image">
<tr><td><img src="pics/trie_ex.jpeg" width="450"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption">Figure 1, Initial Trie.</td></tr>
</table>
</pre>

<p>The grey node in Figure 1 is an unsatisfiable node due to the unsatisfiable
path condition, and the two pink nodes are leaf nodes because of the chosen
depth bound.</p>

<p>Now, suppose the user would like to increase the depth bound to check more
behaviors. The following is the configuration using Memoise:</p>

<pre>
target=Ex
classpath=${jpf-memoise}/build/examples
search.depth_limit=7
symbolic.method=Ex.m(sym#sym#sym)
listener=gov.nasa.jpf.memoise.listener.IDListener
memoise.old_trie_name=trie_ex.dat
memoise.new_trie_name=trie_ex_new.dat
</pre>

<p>Here, the listener IDListener_p is applied. It guides symbolic execution to
explore the new parts because of the increased depth bound, and updates the trie
accordingly. The last two lines specify the name of the trie for reuse and the
name of the updated trie, respectively. 

<p>After running Memoise, an updated trie like the following is generated:</p>

<pre>
<table class="image">
<tr><td><img src="pics/trie_ex_new.jpeg" width="450"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption">Figure 2, Updated Trie.</td></tr>
</table>
</pre>

<p>Figure 2 shows that only nodes (paths) highlighted in red color are explored
guided by the old trie, The others that also exist in the old trie are just
pruned during the search. The two new boundary nodes are generated because of
the increased depth bound, and thereby the tire is updated.

<H2><a name="programs">Example Programs</a></H2>

<p>
The following six example programs are used in the experiments we conducted
to evaluate our proposed approach, with respect to the time and memory cost
incurred by building, storing and retrieving the trie and the savings that can
be achieved with Memoise.</p>

<h3>1. Loops</h3>
<p><a href="downloads/Loops.zip">download</a></p>
     
<p>Looping programs pose particular challenges to symbolic execution and handling
them efficiently is an active area of research. </p>

<p>The LoopExample.java has been used in previous work on loop analysis, where
test inputs are generated to exercise the two specific statements.
The TwoLoopExample.java is similar, except that the part after the first loop is
another loop, instead of a simple conditional statement. </p>


<h3>2. BankAccount</h3>
<p><a href="downloads/BankAccount.zip">download</a></p>

<p>The bank account example has been used previously to illustrate method
sequence generation using symbolic execution and evolutionary testing. The
example implements a bank account service. </p>
     

<h3>3. WBS</h3> 
<p><a href="downloads/WBS.zip">download</a></p>

<p>Wheel Brake System (WBS) is a synchronous reactive component from
the automotive domain. This method determines how much braking pressure to apply
based on the environment. The Java model is based on a Simulink model derived
from the WBS case example found in ARP 4761. The Simulink model was
translated to C using tools developed at Rockwell Collins and manually
translated to Java. It consists of one class and 231 lines of code. </p>

<h3>4. TCAS</h3> 
<p><a href="downloads/TCAS.zip">download</a></p>

<p>Traffic Anti-Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) is a system to avoid air
collisions. Its code in C together with 41 mutants are available at SIR
repository. We manually converted the code to Java. The Java version has 143
lines of code. </p>

<p>The original version v0 and three randomly selected mutant versions v6, v25,
and v30 are used in our study. Compared to the original version v0, version v6
has an operator change from “<” to “<=”, v25 has an operator change, and v30 has
a return value change.</p>


<h3>5. MerArbiter</h3> 
<p><a href="downloads/MerArbiter.zip">download</a></p>

<p>MerArbiter models a component of the flight software for NASA JPL’s Mars
Exploration Rovers (MER). The analyzed software consists of a Resource Arbiter
and several user components. Each user serves one specific application, such as
imaging, controlling the robot arm, communicating with earth, and driving. The
arbiter module moderates access to several shared resources. It prevents
potential conflicts between resource requests coming from different users and
it enforces priorities. For example, it does not make sense to start a
communication session with Earth while the rover is driving. </p>

<p>MerArbiter has been modeled in Simulink/Stateflow and it was automatically
translated into Java using the Polyglot framework. The configuration for our
analysis involved two users and five resources. The example has 268 classes,
553 methods, 4697 lines of code (including the Java Polyglot execution
framework). </p>

<p>There were no version histories available for MerArbiter. We randomly picked
two methods from the original version v0, and manually introduced the
changes. Version v1 has a change to the return value in the method guard of
class Transition300, and version v2 has an operator change from “==” to “! =” in
the method guard of class Transition186. </p>


<h3>6. Apollo</h3>
<p><a href="downloads/Apollo.zip">download</a></p>

<p>The Apollo Lunar Autopilot is a Simulink model that was automatically
translated to Java. The translated Java code has 2.6 KLOC in 54 classes. The
Simulink model was created by an engineer working on the Apollo Lunar Module
digital autopilot design team. The goal was to study how the model could have
been designed in Simulink, if it had been available in 1961. The model is
available from MathWorks6. It contains both Simulink blocks and Stateflow
diagrams and makes use of complex Math functions (e.g. Math.sqrt). The code has
been analyzed before using Symbolic Pathfinder with the Coral solver. </p>
